//! A versatile and easy to use defer statement for Rust. Similar to Go's or Zig's defer.
//!
//! This crate is compatible uses `no_std`.
//! The default features use `alloc`
//! To disable alloc set default-features to false in cargo.toml.
//!
//! This crates provides 6 macros for different use cases of deferment:
//! 1. `defer!` simple deferment. Will execute when current scope ends.
//!
//! 2. `defer_move!` same as `defer!` but moves local variables into the closure.
//!
//! 3. `defer_guard!` Returns a guard that causes execution when its scope ends.
//!     - Execution can be canceled or preempted.
//!
//! 4. `defer_move_guard!` Same as `defer_guard!` but moves local variables into the closure.
//!
//! 5. `defer_arc!` Returns a reference counted guard than can be shared with other threads.
//!     - Execution can be canceled or preempted.
//!     - Closure must be `Send`
//!     - Target must support Arc & AtomicBool.
//!     - Target must support alloc
//!     - can be disabled with `default-features=false` in Cargo.toml
//!
//! 6. `defer_move_arc!` Same as `defer_arc!` but moves local variables into the closure.
//!     - All used local variables must be `Send`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Add the dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! defer-heavy = "0.1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Order of execution
//! Rust guarantees that the order in which the closures are dropped
//! (and therefore executed) are in reverse order of creation.
//! This means the last `defer!` in the scope executes first.
//!
//!
